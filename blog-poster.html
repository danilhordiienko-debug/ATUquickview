      <h1 class="page-title">How the ATU QuickView Poster Was Designed</h1>
      <p class="page-subtitle">
        A visual explanation of the QuickView concept, shown through an illustration students can understand in just a few seconds.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>From tab chaos to one simple solution</h2>
      <p>
        The idea for the ATU QuickView poster began with a real student problem: 
        first-years constantly switch between Moodle, Timetables, Outlook, Library, Calendar, and Student Hub. 
        With each system on a different page, many students feel overwhelmed before they even start studying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our poster represents that stress visually. The student at the bottom is surrounded by flying browser windows,
        books and notifications – showing the academic chaos many ATU students experience daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above him, the central message in a bright speech bubble reads:
        <strong>“ONE SITE — ALL THE PAGES THAT YOU NEED AS A STUDENT.”</strong>
        This slogan communicates the purpose of ATU QuickView in one sentence.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why we chose an octopus</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of using plain icons, we illustrated a friendly ATU octopus character holding all major student systems:
        Timetables, Moodle, Outlook, Calendar, and Student Hub. Each tentacle reaches toward a platform, mirroring how 
        QuickView works: <strong>one central start page that connects everything students already use.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The octopus also holds a phone displaying QuickView, showing that the website works on both laptop and mobile.
        The playful cartoon style helps the poster feel student-friendly and immediately readable from a distance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Colour, style and visual hierarchy</h2>
      <p>
        We used bright comic-style colours and energetic background rays so the poster stands out on campus walls.
        The orange “ALL-IN-ONE!” title and yellow speech bubble draw attention first, ensuring the key message
        is seen even in a quick glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The layout follows a strong visual hierarchy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Top:</strong> the slogan explaining the benefit</li>
        <li><strong>Middle:</strong> the octopus connecting all tools</li>
        <li><strong>Bottom:</strong> the stressed student representing the problem</li>
        <li><strong>Footer:</strong> QuickView logo, URL, and QR code leading to the prototype</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, these elements tell a complete story: students go from confusion to clarity through one simple hub.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Linking the poster to the prototype</h2>
      <p>
        At the bottom of the poster, the ATU QuickView logo, the strong <strong>“ALL-IN-ONE!”</strong> headline, the URL 
        and a QR code guide students directly to the prototype website.
      </p>
      <p>
        The poster is not just decorative: it works as a fast shortcut. In just one scan, students can try the interface 
        themselves and see how ATU QuickView simplifies their daily academic tools.
