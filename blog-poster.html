      <h1 class="page-title">How the ATU QuickView Poster Was Designed</h1>
      <p class="page-subtitle">
        A visual explanation of the ATU QuickView concept for students who only have a few seconds
        to notice a poster on a wall or screen.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>From crowded systems to one clear message</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the ATU QuickView poster was to communicate a very simple idea:
        “All the important ATU systems in one place.” First-year students often see
        names like Moodle, Timetables, Outlook, Library and Student Hub, but they
        do not always understand what each one does. The poster had to summarise
        the benefit of the website in one clean visual without overwhelming them
        with text.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve this, the layout focuses on a strong title, a short subtitle and
        a central graphic. The title uses clear, readable typography that can be
        recognised from a distance. The subtitle explains that ATU QuickView is a
        starting page that connects all the different platforms students already use.
      </p>

      <h2>Colour, icon and hierarchy</h2>
      <p>
        The colour palette links directly to the ATU brand while staying soft and
        student-friendly. A blue gradient background suggests technology and trust,
        while lighter elements highlight the call-to-action. The graduation-cap icon
        from the website is repeated on the poster to create a visual connection
        with the ATU QuickView landing page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information is organised in a clear hierarchy. At the top, students see
        the name of the project. In the middle, a short sentence describes the
        value: one place to open Moodle, timetables, email and more. At the bottom,
        there is a clear instruction: “Visit the ATU QuickView prototype website”
        with a URL or QR code that points to the landing page.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Connecting poster and website for SEO</h2>
      <p>
        Although a physical poster is not directly part of search engine optimisation,
        the language used on the poster matches the keywords used on this website:
        “ATU student hub”, “timetables”, “Moodle”, “library”, “email” and “Student Hub”.
        When students search for these terms online, the blog posts and landing page
        reinforce the same message that they saw in the poster.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way the poster does more than decorate a noticeboard. It becomes a
        visual shortcut to the ATU QuickView prototype and helps students understand
        why a single digital starting point is useful.
