      <p class="page-subtitle">
        Looking at the everyday experience of a first-year student who has to use
        Moodle, timetables, email, the Library and Student Hub every week.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Too many platforms, not enough time</h2>
      <p>
        A typical ATU student starts the week by opening the timetable website to
        check rooms, then moves to Moodle to view lecture notes, then opens Outlook
        to read new messages, and finally logs into Student Hub to see exam or fees
        information. Each platform has a separate URL, separate login flow and a
        different visual style. For an experienced user this might be fine, but for
        new students it can be confusing and stressful.
      </p>
      <p>
        When systems are scattered, students develop unofficial strategies such as
        bookmarking a random set of links, relying on old emails or asking friends
        where a particular piece of information is stored. This takes mental energy
        that could be better used for studying.
      </p>

      <h2>What a single hub can change</h2>
      <p>
        ATU QuickView does not replace any official system. Instead, it acts as a
        neutral landing page that sits above them. The page uses clear headings
        such as “Moodle”, “Timetables”, “Library”, “Outlook Email” and “Student Hub”.
        Under each heading there is a short explanation of what the system is for
        and a button that opens the real website.
      </p>
      <p>
        For services like Moodle and the Student Hub, the prototype also offers
        a mini embedded view. This allows students to quickly check the real site
        in a small frame without leaving the landing page. If they want to do more,
        they can open the system in a new tab.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>SEO and discoverability</h2>
      <p>
        The blog posts on this site are written with common student search terms
        in mind: “ATU timetable”, “ATU Moodle login”, “ATU student hub”, “ATU
        library opening hours”. By combining these keywords with helpful content,
        the ATU QuickView prototype would be easier to discover through search
        engines if it were deployed online.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice this means that a student searching for “ATU timetable and
        Moodle in one place” could land on the QuickView page, understand the
        structure of the university systems and quickly find the links they need.
