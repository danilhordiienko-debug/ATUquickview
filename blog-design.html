      <p class="page-subtitle">
        From early sketches to a working HTML/CSS prototype that could one day
        grow into a real student portal.
      </p>

      <h2>Starting with the user journey</h2>
      <p>
        The design process began with a simple question: what does an ATU student
        actually do in a normal week? Mapping the journey showed that they move
        between several digital touchpoints – Moodle for modules, timetables for
        rooms, Outlook for communication, the Library for resources and Student
        Hub for admin tasks. The prototype was planned as a “first stop” that
        connects all of these points in a friendly way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early wireframes focused on grouping services by purpose and keeping the
        amount of text short. Each service card needed just enough description
        so that a first-year student could understand what the button would do
        without reading a long paragraph.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Visual design decisions</h2>
      <p>
        The interface uses a clean white background with soft blue gradients to
        echo ATU branding while keeping the mood light and modern. The service
        cards have rounded corners, subtle shadows and colourful icons to make
        each system feel approachable instead of intimidating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buttons are designed with strong contrast and clear labels such as
        “Open Moodle mini view” or “Open Outlook in New Tab”. This reduces the
        cognitive load on the user and supports accessibility. The layout remains
        responsive so that the page can be viewed on laptops, tablets and phones.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Implementing the prototype</h2>
      <p>
        The prototype is built using semantic HTML, a custom CSS file and a small
        JavaScript file. JavaScript handles smooth scrolling for the top navigation
        and toggles the embedded mini views using simple classes. This keeps the
        code easy to understand and suitable for an Interaction Design or Project
        Management assignment, while still feeling like a real product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the site does not integrate with official ATU APIs, it links to
        the live Moodle, timetable, library, Outlook and Student Hub sites. This
        makes the prototype realistic enough for usability testing with students
        and offers a strong foundation if the university ever chooses to develop
        a more advanced dashboard.
